->all users must create an account and sign in

before they can start sending or receiving messages.

So that will be the first step.

Adding user authentication will be the first step

and therefore, of course, we need a screen and a form

so a combination of inputs

that in the end allows users to sign in

because when we talk about user authentication,

we are in the end talking about the front end

and the backend communicating with each other again,

the front end is our flatter app

and the backend could be any remote server,

either a server fully controlled and programmed by you

with your own server side code.

->as part of that sign-up and process,

your front end app has to collect the user credentials,

the user data, so email and password, for example,

and it then must send that data to the backend

where it can be stored in a database,

but where it also can be validated

so that after you created a user,

once the user wants to log in,

those credentials are sent to the backend again,

and then there the backend basically checks whether email

and password match the email and password

stored in the database.

->We need a screen and a form in the Flutter app

that does allow a user to enter their credentials,

so email and password, for example,

and we need a backend that supports user authentication.

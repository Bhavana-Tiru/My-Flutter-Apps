The useMaterial3: true flag is no longer needed if you're using the latest version of Flutter - because Material 3 is already the default with that.

In addition, instead of adding a dark theme like this:

ThemeData.dark(
  useMaterial3: true,
  colorScheme: kColorScheme,
  cardTheme: ...
)
you should add it like this (in the next lecture, when we write that code):

ThemeData.dark().copyWith( // dark() no longer takes any arguments
  useMaterial3: true,
  colorScheme: kColorScheme,
  cardTheme: ...
)
